# Task 8 Implementation - Auxiliary Endpoints for Admin Registration Form

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of auxiliary endpoints required for the admin registration form as specified in task 8.

## Implemented Endpoints

### 1. ✅ GET /api/cities
**Status**: Already implemented in `location_handler.go`
- Returns list of all cities with their regions and countries
- Used by the frontend to populate the city selector
- Response format:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "city_id": "uuid",
      "name": "City Name",
      "region": "Region Name", 
      "country": "Country Name"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. ✅ GET /api/sports  
**Status**: Already implemented in `location_handler.go`
- Returns list of all available sports
- Used by the frontend to populate the sport selector
- Response format:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "sport_id": "uuid",
      "name": "Sport Name",
      "description": "Sport Description"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. ✅ GET /api/admin/validate-email
**Status**: Already implemented in `admin_handler.go`
- Validates email format and uniqueness
- Includes security checks and rate limiting
- Query parameter: `email`
- Response format:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "is_valid": true,
    "is_unique": true,
    "message": "Email is available"
  }
}
```

### 4. ✅ GET /api/admin/list (NEW)
**Status**: Newly implemented
- Returns paginated list of administrators with filtering and search
- Requires super_admin authentication
- Query parameters:
  - `page` (int, default: 1)
  - `limit` (int, default: 20, max: 100)
  - `search` (string) - searches in first_name, last_name, email
  - `city_id` (uuid) - filter by city
  - `sport_id` (uuid) - filter by sport  
  - `status` (string) - filter by account status
  - `sort_by` (string) - sort field (first_name, last_name, email, created_at, last_login_at)
  - `sort_order` (string) - asc or desc

- Response format:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "admins": [
      {
        "user_id": "uuid",
        "email": "admin@example.com",
        "first_name": "John",
        "last_name": "Doe", 
        "phone": "+1234567890",
        "photo_url": "https://example.com/photo.jpg",
        "account_status": "active",
        "is_active": true,
        "city_name": "Bogotá",
        "sport_name": "Fútbol",
        "last_login_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
        "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
      }
    ],
    "total": 50,
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 20,
    "total_pages": 3,
    "has_next": true,
    "has_prev": false
  }
}
```

## Implementation Details

### New Data Models Added
- `AdminListRequest` - Request parameters for admin list endpoint
- `AdminSummary` - Summary information for each admin in the list
- `AdminListResponse` - Paginated response structure

### Service Layer Implementation
- Added `GetAdminList()` method to `AdminService`
- Implements complex SQL query with JOINs to get city and sport names
- Supports dynamic filtering and sorting
- Includes proper pagination logic
- Uses parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection

### Handler Layer Implementation  
- Added `GetAdminList()` method to `AdminHandler`
- Includes request validation using struct tags
- Proper error handling with specific error codes
- Requires super_admin authentication via middleware

### Security Features
- Rate limiting protection
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- Authentication and authorization checks
- Audit logging for security events

### Database Query Optimization
- Uses LEFT JOINs to get related city and sport names
- DISTINCT clause to handle multiple role assignments
- Proper indexing support for filtering and sorting
- Efficient pagination with LIMIT and OFFSET

## Testing

The implementation has been successfully compiled and is ready for testing. To test the endpoints:

1. Start the server: `./api.exe`
2. Authenticate as super_admin to get JWT token
3. Test the endpoints:

```bash
# Get cities
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/cities"

# Get sports  
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/sports"

# Validate email
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/admin/validate-email?email=test@example.com" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"

# Get admin list with filters
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/admin/list?page=1&limit=10&search=john&sort_by=created_at&sort_order=desc" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

## Requirements Fulfilled

✅ **Requirement 1.4**: Dynamic city and sport selectors implemented
✅ **Requirement 9.1**: Email uniqueness validation implemented  
✅ **Requirement 9.2**: Admin list with search and filtering implemented
✅ **Security**: All endpoints include proper authentication, validation, and security measures
✅ **Performance**: Efficient queries with pagination and proper indexing support

## Next Steps

The auxiliary endpoints are now complete and ready for frontend integration. The next phase (Task 9) will focus on implementing the email notification system for sending welcome emails with temporary passwords.
